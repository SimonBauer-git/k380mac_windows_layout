# k380mac_windows_layout
German keyboard layout for the k380 for mac keyboard. Under windows, using this keyboard is kind of a pain, because the keys <> and ^Â° are swapped for some bizarre reason. 
i used microsoft keyboard layout creator 1.4 to create a custom keyboard layout, removing the sticky ^ key, because you otherwise couldnt use the <> keys normally. 
to use it, just click on setup.exe and reboot your pc if it doesnt show up. if you also use normal keyboards, add a second language (i used german (austria) for example), and then add the keyboard (ususally named Deutsch -Custom or something). 
if you then want to switch, use the windows and space keys.
